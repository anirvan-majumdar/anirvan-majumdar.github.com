  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been about a week since I&rsquo;ve withdrawn from my daily activities at
LoReMo. Things haven&rsquo;t really looked up for us, and after trying for quite
long time, we finally decided to cut back on our efforts at LoReMo. In short,
we decided to <em>wind down</em>.</p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t something easy, as can be expected. After nearly 26 months, it&rsquo;s
always going to be hard to shut down the primary outlet of your intellectual
efforts. The upside being that we made it through the long haul, and proved
our capability to build a product which received reasonable acceptance. This
post isn&rsquo;t about the reasons which led to its eventual end (that&rsquo;ll be for
some time later), but more about what all I got to learn, and what I have in
mind henceforth.</p>

<h4>Things We Built</h4>

<p>LoReMo was meant to be a product for users to keep track of their engagement
with different brands. The primary aspects of engagement involved &mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Deals</em> &ndash; merchants would keep users informed of deals running at
their stores. Also, these deals could be targeted based on parameters selected
by the merchant.</li>
<li><em>Rewards</em> &ndash; a simple rewards points-based strategy to indicate when
users were eligible for free rewards. These points were earned against
transactions, and other activities like sharing merchant deals on social networks,
inviting friends, reviewing a merchant, etc. We felt in the current context
of smart devices, merchants do stand to gain a lot from incentivizing different
mediums of engagement than relying solely on the age old custom of transactions.</li>
</ol>


<p>Users got to use a smartphone app, while merchants got a web-based dashboard
to track and analyse things.</p>

<p>Just <em>reiterating</em> again &ndash; this post isn&rsquo;t about what went wrong.</p>

<p>Alright, so where were we? Oh yeah, things we built. To realise this product,
we planned to get ourselves on all the smartphone platforms (which isn&rsquo;t really the wisest
things to do in hindsight). The following were the major chunks where our efforts
got invested &mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Apps</em> &ndash; one for each of the platforms &ndash; Android, iOS, Windows Phone and
Blackberry.</li>
<li>A backend <em>REST server</em> capable of scaling easily, and responsible for serving
the data requested by the app users.</li>
<li>A pair of <em>replicating MySQL databases</em> to provide some sort of simple redundancy,
and enhanced speed. We split our read and write calls between these 2 DB servers
and saw a lot of gain.</li>
<li><em>Distributed caching mechanism</em> &ndash; which provided a lot of boost to our
REST servers&#8217; capability to respond. Most of the inbound requests were afterall
read-oriented.</li>
<li><em>Jobs scheduler</em> &ndash; this wasn&rsquo;t part of original plan, but quickly we
realised the need for having this. This nifty piece of software did a bunch of
batch processing for computing user behaviour, sending out automated SMS&rsquo;s and
mailers, and running data integrity checks.</li>
<li><em>Merchant dashboard</em> &ndash; a fairly non-trivial web application which was
used by the merchants to primarily fill up form based data related to deals,
rewards, stores and reward points strategies.</li>
</ol>


<p>All in all, the last 26 months were spent on setting up these 6 disparate systems
and perfecting them. Eventually, our efforts did get concentrated on a few, but
each one of them got their fair share of attention every once in a while.<br/>
The tech stack we used primarily involved the following &mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Languages</em> &ndash; A whole lot of <code>Java</code>, <code>Objective C</code>, <code>C#</code> and <code>Javascript</code>.</li>
<li><em>Servers</em> &ndash; We made use of <code>Tomcats</code> which were customised to allow distributed
sessions, allowing us to load balance them behind an <code>Apache 2.4</code> web server. <code>mod_jk</code> FTW!</li>
<li><em>Caching</em> &ndash; we made use of the excellent <code>Hazelcast</code> library to achieve this. We
had evaluated <code>memcached</code> and <code>ehcache</code> too. But eventually <code>hazelcast</code> came through
because of its ability to run within an existing Java process, and the availability of
a centralized <code>management-center</code> portal, which allowed us to view and manage caches.</li>
<li><em>Persistence</em> &ndash; we used replicating set of MySQL databases, and another replicating
set of <code>MongoDB</code> servers. The <code>MySQL</code> servers provided the primary persistence store for
all clients, while the <code>MongoDB</code> was brought in primarily to cater to unstructured data
and geo-spatial lookup of location based data.</li>
<li><em>UI</em> &ndash; for the apps, our focus was usually on the Android version, and then we
would port the features, both functional and visual, to the other platforms. This was an
immense drag on our resources, but that was something we had a fair idea about and went
ahead in spite of the obvious downsides.<br/>
For the web application user interface, we relied on <code>Bootstrap</code> in a big way, and made use
of the beautiful <code>Highcharts</code> charting JS library for analytics.</li>
<li><em>Search</em> &ndash; initially we relied on MySQL&rsquo;s index-based searches, but soon, the
inflexibility of writing and combining different resultsets led us to <code>lucene</code>.</li>
<li><em>Testing</em> &ndash; we never really ventured into the unit testing world â€” bar some
functions which certainly led them to be unit tested. Our focus had primarily been
on the performance parameters of the REST application when a whole lot requests hit it.
To determine the stability of the system in the face of good number of requests, we relied
on the super performant <code>grinder</code> framework. It worked as a charm and allowed us to test
various kinds of loads. We tested against burst loads (500 users at a time), sustained loads
(10 million requests over 5 days of running). The way our application performed against
Grinder gave us an immense degree of confidence. And in the long run, it turned out to
be a great source of stability for the platform too.</li>
<li><em>SCM</em> &ndash; we relied on ever trusty <code>Git</code> for this purpose. And it never-ever failed us!
Initially we had our own centralized server, which we set up using <code>gitolite</code>, until our
server kept failing us repeatedly. your scm server is one thing you don&rsquo;t want to keep
failing on you, esp when you&rsquo;ve got a team working on many different things. True, I could&rsquo;ve
hosted the entire thing on my laptop, but then, most of us were working from home most of the
time, and I really didn&rsquo;t want people not to commit stuff upstream just because they couldn&rsquo;t
connect to the central repo. Finally we moved to the brilliant <code>gitlab</code> hosted service. It&rsquo;s
free, and borrows a lot of its functionalities from Github. Very easy and reliable. However,
the web portal is a tad bit slow.</li>
</ol>


<p>So that&rsquo;s how things were laid out for LoReMo. Almost everything besides the first iterations
of the apps and the REST server came into place in an incremental and totally need-to-have
basis. Of course, at the end, we did allow ourselves some luxuries which weren&rsquo;t really a
necessity, like the distributed cache. But what the heck, we thought it would&rsquo;ve been nice
to have, and it took just a week to put it in.</p>
