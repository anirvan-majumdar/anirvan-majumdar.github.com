    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So well, I&rsquo;m trying (<em>yet again</em>) to sit down and write and express things
through a nifty blogging mechanism — <em>Octopress</em>. Why I chose this over
Wordpress?</p>

<ul>
<li>Hmm, I think it has a bit to do with the fact that this was
somewhat harder to setup — <em>hence</em>, the novelty factor.</li>
<li>As an author I can control far more things, far easier. Like the placing
of text blocks and images.</li>
<li><em>Code blocks</em> — oh they render so well. I know there&rsquo;s
<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/prettify-code-syntax/">prettify</a> and what not
on WP, but the fact remains, it&rsquo;s all baked into Octo already.<br/>
Case in point &mdash;</li>
</ul>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Writing and formatting stuff in <em>markdown</em> is way more natural than in WP.</li>
<li>No database required!</li>
<li>The installation and deployment process takes one through the narrow and
often winding lanes of github (i.e, if you chose to host it on <a href="http://pages.github.com">pages</a>,
ruby, git, saas, yaml, and some more which I&rsquo;ve ignored right now.</li>
<li>and of course, it&rsquo;s got this whole <em>geeky</em> feel to it. There&rsquo;s this sense of
accomplishment associated with the whole process.</li>
<li>free deployment against your own <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">custom URL</a>
using Github pages. Last I saw, WP was charging for that!</li>
</ul>


<h4>It&rsquo;s not all easy-peasy though!</h4>

<p>From the point you decide to have an Octo blog, to finally having one deployed
can be quite a handful. Especially more so, if you got a bit self assured of
your own obvious intelligence. Well I did.<br/>
I was using a Mac, and the first thing is to get Ruby 1.9.3 installed. It was no
fun, since I apparently had Ruby 1.8.x preinstalled, and didn&rsquo;t have much clue
how to go about uninstalling it. Suggestions on the web generally indicated that
all you need to do is change the <code>PATH</code> variable. But then, I ran into some
shit storm since I didn&rsquo;t have <code>gcc</code> installed for compiling the binaries. This
is because I recently updated my XCode, and that took away the command lines
tools installed before. So before I could figure that out, I had gotten into
MacPorts, Homebrew and Fink. They all were basically puking into each others
dependencies. And it all had to undone.</p>

<blockquote><p>First thing to make sure &mdash; have you got your command line tools installed<br/>on XCode?</p></blockquote>


<p><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/I0yhAZa.png" width="500" height="366"></p>

<p>Once the <code>gcc</code> is taken care of, the next thing I got entangled with was Github
pages. This part, I believe, had more to do with my impatience than any real
issue as such. You need to be a little careful about the documentation and how
the folder structure of your Octo clone maps to Github pages.
When you do a <code>git clone</code> on the original Octo repo, you get what is known as
the root directory. When you run the standard Octo <code>rake</code> commands, like
<code>generate</code>, <code>deploy</code>, etc, another directory <code>_deploy</code> is created within the <code>source</code>
directory. This <code>_deploy</code> directory is <em>also</em> a valid git project.<br/>
Now, on the Github pages side of things, depending on what kind of blog you
want to float &ndash; personal, official, team &ndash; you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://github.com/new">create a new repository</a>
for that. Now, the <code>master</code> branch should map to the <code>_deploy</code> folder, while
a new branch <code>source</code> should map to the root folder. If all this sounds a bit
hard to follow, just be sure that you fire the <code>rake</code> commands in the correct
order as instructed in the documentation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake of fiddling around with the root folder setting in the<br/>_config.yml file, or through the rake set_root_dir[] command before getting<br/>your blog live!</p></blockquote>


<p>If you do something like that, chances are, your JS, CSS and other linked files
will not get resolved properly. In case you&rsquo;ve done anything like that, make
sure that the <code>root</code> setting under Jekyll parameters in the <code>_config.yml</code> file
is set to empty. And then, execute the commant <code>rake set_root_dir[/]</code> to fix
the relative paths generated in the generated <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<h4>Getting to See the Damn Thing</h4>

<p>You can view the blog locally before pushing it live. To do so, use the
<code>rake generate</code> and then <code>rake preview</code> command. Then access your blog at
<a href="http://localhost:4000">localhost:4000</a>. You can even edit your posts in
realtime and review the changes.<br/>
To deploy your blog live on Github pages, use the command <code>rake deploy</code> (assuming
you have already run <code>rake generate</code> before). This will create all the new
files in the <code>_deploy</code> folder and push these files to the <code>master</code> branch
on your Github pages repository. All you need to do then is access your
live blog at <code>http://&lt;github-username&gt;.github.com</code> (the <code>.com</code> or <code>.io</code> is the same
thing. No difference.)</p>
