    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been about a week since I&rsquo;ve withdrawn from my daily activities at
LoReMo. Things haven&rsquo;t really looked up for us, and after trying for quite
long time, we finally decided to cut back on our efforts at LoReMo. In short,
we decided to <em>wind down</em>.</p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t something easy, as can be expected. After nearly 26 months, it&rsquo;s
always going to be hard to shut down the primary outlet of your intellectual
efforts. The upside being that we made it through the long haul, and proved
our capability to build a product which received reasonable acceptance. This
post isn&rsquo;t about the reasons which led to its eventual end (that&rsquo;ll be for
some time later), but more about what all I got to learn, and what I have in
mind henceforth.</p>
